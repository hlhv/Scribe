[![The one part of HLHV that has decent code.](https://img.shields.io/badge/go%20report-A+-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/hlhv/scribe)

Scribe is a thread safe logging system that uses semantic symbols to make logs
easier to read. It is built specifically for HLHV cells. It wraps the standard
`log` library.

It has the ability to manage a directory of log files, separating them by date.

Here is some example output, generated by
[the HLHV queen cell](https://github.com/hlhv/hlhv-queen):
